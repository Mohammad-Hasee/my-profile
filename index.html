        <p>I am Mohammad Hasib but everyone calls me Redoy. After graduating in Computer Science from 
            Bangladesh University of Business and Technology, I completed a three month short course on 
            web design at BITM. My home is Mirpur. The house is in Shahjadpur of Sirajganj.
            We are two brothers and one sister. I was big. I played a lot of sports in our field.
            I was the district champion in cricket. I used to maintain cultural programs. I used to do tuition in Dhaka. 
            If someone asks me for a task, I listen carefully first and understand well what I have to do. 
            I am a person who is positive in every aspect of life. There are so many things I love to do, see and experience.
            I want to read. </p>
